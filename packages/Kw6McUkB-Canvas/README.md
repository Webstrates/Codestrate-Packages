<h2>Description</h2><p>Add drawing capabililties to body paragraphs and slides. Latter requires the presentation package.</p><p>The Canvas Mutation Observer code paragraph is run-on-load and observes the codestrate for body paragraphs that have the class canvas. A body paragraph will be upgraded in a canvas when the canvas class is set; and downgraded when the canvas class is removed.<br></p><p>The Pen Tips code paragraph implements a felt pen algorithm that generates felt-pen-like stroke paths.<br></p><p>The Canvas code paragraph modifies a body paragraph of class canvas to allow whiteboard-like drawing. Therefore, it adds a SVG element to the body paragraph, if it does not exist. It further adds event listeners to the body paragraph to listen for pen and eraser events. Currently these events are hard-coded, but may be dynamically assignable by the user. On pen down event, it generates a path and on pen move it generates a stroke based on the pen points. On eraser move events, it checks for intersections of the eraser movement and path elements in the SVG element. If the eraser movement and a path element intersect, the path element will be removed.<br></p>
